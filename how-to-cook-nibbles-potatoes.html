If <b>potatoes</b> are produced during a very dry growing season, they will tend to have a higher than normal solid content and less moisture. When these are cooked, they absorb more water than usual and, as a result, <b>fall apart</b> at the end of <b>cooking</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-soak-potatoes-in-cold-water-before-cooking></span>Why Soak potatoes in cold water before cooking?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Soaking</b> peeled, washed and cut fries in <b>cold water</b> overnight removes excess <b>potato</b> starch, which prevents fries from sticking together and helps achieve maximum crispness.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6pLvOpGSnoZKXuaa%2FjKmmrZmkpLK0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nothing-bad-can-happen-2014.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nothing Bad Can Happen movie review (2014)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./duncan-williamss-ex-wife-rev-francisca-explains-why-she-still-uses-her-ex-husbands-surname-more-watch.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Duncan-Williamss Ex-Wife, Rev.

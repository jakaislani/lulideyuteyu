When his father was imprisoned amid financial and political scandal, Kushner took over the family business and also went into publishing with his purchase of The New York Observer. In 2009, he wed <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/ivanka-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ivanka Trump" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ivanka Trump</a>, daughter of another real estate mogul, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donald Trump</a>. Kushner served as a close political advisor to Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign and his transition to the White House. He was named a senior adviser to the president in January 2017.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kushner was born on January 10, 1981, in Livingston, New Jersey. He is one of four children of Charles Kushner, a billionaire real estate developer who was also a major financial supporter of the Democratic Party and various charities. His younger brother is businessman and investor Joshua Kushner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After attending the Frisch School, a yeshiva high school in Paramus, New Jersey, the younger Kushner went on to Harvard University and graduated in 2003. (A journalist would later <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.propublica.org/article/the-story-behind-jared-kushners-curious-acceptance-into-harvard data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=report class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">report</a> that Kushner, who had a modest academic record in high school, was granted admission to Harvard after his father offered an endowment to the university. A spokeperson for Kushner Companies responded to the allegation saying it "is and always has been false.")</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Father's Arrest</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2005, Charles plead guilty to crimes that included tax evasion and witness tampering, as well as making illegal political campaign donations. He received a two-year prison sentence. The elder Kushner was prosecuted by then-U.S. attorney and future New Jersey governor Chris Christie, with whom Kusher would later work as part of an advisory team for Trump’s presidential run.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Charles was in prison, Jared took over the real estate business while maintaining a close relationship to his father. In 2006, Kushner purchased The New York Observer and became a publisher while only in his mid-20s. The following year he made news again with his purchase of a Manhattan office building at 666 Fifth Avenue for the then-record sum of $1.8 billion. Kushner became the CEO of Kushner Companies in 2008.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Marriage to Ivanka Trump</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After dating for almost two years, Kushner wed Ivanka Trump, daughter of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/ivana-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ivana class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ivana</a> and Donald Trump, in October 2009 in Bedminster, New Jersey. The couple have three children — Arabella, Joseph and Theodore. Ivanka also converted to Orthodox Judaism, which is Kushner’s faith.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Adviser to Donald Trump</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite coming from a Democratic family, Kushner became a key adviser to Trump as he campaigned to become the Republican nominee for president in 2016. Kushner reportedly worked with Trump on various campaign activities, including merchandising, crafting speeches, social media outreach and the selection of Indiana governor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/mike-pence data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mike Pence" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Mike Pence</a> as the vice-presidential candidate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kushner found himself involved in a political storm during the summer when Trump tweeted a meme, originally posted on an alt-right message board, labeling <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/hillary-clinton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hillary Clinton " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Hillary Clinton </a>as highly corrupt with an image evocative of the Star of David and money in the background. An uproar ensued over the anti-Semitic implications of the post. Kushner <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://observer.com/2016/07/jared-kushner-the-donald-trump-i-know/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="defended Trump via the Observer" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">defended Trump via the Observer</a> and said his father-in-law was not an anti-Semite, stating that the presidential candidate should not be blamed for messaging from supporters who harbor hate-filled, destructive views.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After Trump won the presidential election on November 8, 2016, Kushner became a central part of his transition team. Despite the speculation that Kushner would return to his personal business ventures post-election, it was reported that he had sought legal counsel about the possibility of joining Trump’s administration, leaving him open to problems ranging from nepotism restrictions in the executive branch to financial conflicts of interest. In 2016, the Kushner family net worth was estimated to be $1.8 billion, the majority of which was in real-estate property holdings, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2016/12/18/jared-josh-kushner-fortune-donald-trump-real-estate/#560317842acf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Forbes class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Forbes</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In January 2017, Trump's transition team announced that Kushner would be named as a senior adviser to the president.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Russian Investigation</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On July 24, 2017, Kushner met with Senate Intelligence Committee staff to explain his contact with Russians as part of an ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Prior to the meeting, Kushner released an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/24/politics/jared-kushner-statement-russia-2016-election/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="11-page statement" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">11-page statement</a> in which he denied collusion with the Russian government. He also provided details of four meetings he had with Russians during the presidential campaign and Trump’s transition to the White House, including two interactions with the Russian ambassador, a meeting with a Russian banker and another meeting set up by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/donald-trump-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donald Trump Jr.</a> with a Russian lawyer who offered compromising information about presidential opponent Clinton.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kusher denied improper contact during these meetings, stating: "I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In early November, CNN reported that Kushner had turned over documents to special counsel <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/robert-mueller data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Mueller" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Mueller</a>, who was leading his own expansive investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. According to CNN's sources, Mueller's investigators were looking into Kushner's role in the May 2017 firing of FBI Director <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/james-comey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="James Comey" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">James Comey</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kushner soon found himself in the sights of the Senate Judiciary Committee again, over his forwarding of emails that included mention of WikiLeaks and a "Russian backdoor overture and dinner invite." Although other parties had included those emails in submitted documents, Kushner failed to do so.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Additional legal problems surfaced in December when a Washington attorney filed a lawsuit over illegal omissions from Kushner's public financial disclosure forms. According to the suit, both Kushner and Ivanka had neglected to identify the assets owned by numerous investment firms that retained their business, as well as the income derived from two investment vehicles. A White House spokesman dismissed the lawsuit as "frivolous," saying the disclosures of the two presidential advisers satisfied all legal requirements.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Intelligence and Security Issues</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to a January 2018 Wall Street Journal article, counterintelligence officials had warned Kushner that Wendi Deng Murdoch, a Chinese American businesswoman and the former wife of News Corp. chairman <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/rupert-murdoch data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rupert Murdoch" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rupert Murdoch</a>, might leverage her friendship with him to aid Chinese government interests. Murdoch subsequently denied involvement in such endeavors and knowledge of any intelligence agency concerns.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In late February 2018, following Chief of Staff John Kelly's announcement that he would overhaul the security clearance process for White House personnel, Kushner’s interim status was downgraded from the top-secret to the secret level, due to the fact that he had yet to receive final clearance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shortly afterward, The Washington Post reported that U.S. officials had intercepted conversations from members of at least four foreign governments — China, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico and Israel — about ways in which they could take advantage of Kushner's business dealings and lack of foreign policy experience. According to the report, some in the White House were concerned that Kushner was "naive and being tricked" in conversations with foreign officials.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Security issues notwithstanding, Kushner soon joined a delegation that met with Mexican President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figure/enrique-pena-nieto data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Enrique Peña Nieto" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Enrique Peña Nieto</a> to discuss matters of security, immigration and trade. The visit was scheduled after Peña Nieto abruptly canceled his planned trip to Washington.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kushner received his top-secret security clearance in May 2018, though The New York Times later reported that this was due to President Trump's influence on the matter.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Questionable Housing Documents and Loans</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In March 2018, news surfaced of Kushner's former real-estate business, the Kushner Cos., filing false reports with New York City in order to skirt rent-control laws. According to the Housing Rights Initiative, the Kushner Cos. submitted at least 80 false applications for construction permits in 34 buildings across the city from 2013 to 2016; the applications indicated that there were no rent-regulated tenants, when in fact there were more than 300.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Additionally, some residents complained of construction at all hours after Kushner bought the buildings, which they believed was part of an effort to drive them out and allow the company to hike up rents for new tenants.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Kushner Cos. responded by saying it outsources the preparation of the reports to third parties, and takes immediate corrective steps when mistakes are discovered. "Kushner would never deny any tenant their due-process rights," said the company in a statement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around that time, The New York Times reported that Citigroup had lent Kushner Cos. and one of its partners $325 million in 2017 after Citigroup’s CEO, Michael Corbat, met with Kushner in the White House. The revelation prompted Democratic lawmakers to request documentation from Kushner Cos., and set off a White House investigation into whether its former head violated any criminal laws or regulations with his actions.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Coronavirus</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When the coronavirus pandemic emerged as a global threat in the early months of 2020, President Trump tapped to Vice President Pence to lead the administration's task force, while also enlisting his son-in-law to oversee crucial behind-the-scenes developments in the race to contain the outbreak.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to reports, Kushner initially focused on such areas as expanding test access for the public, beefing up industrial production of medical supplies and determining where the supplies were most needed, his influence holding sway over the decision-making at the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p><ul data-node-id=39 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Jared Kushner</li><li>Birth Year: 1981</li><li>Birth date: January 10, 1981</li><li>Birth State: New Jersey</li><li>Birth City: Livingston</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Jared Kushner is a real estate developer, former publisher and Donald Trump's son-in-law.

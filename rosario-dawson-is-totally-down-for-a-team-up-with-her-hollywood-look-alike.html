Celebrities who look so similar they could be related are actually not that uncommon in Tinseltown, with notable mentions being Isla Fisher and Amy Adams, Matt Bomer and Henry Cavill, and Kiera Knightly and Natalie Portman, with the last pair having once looked so similar that one played the others double in the 00‚Äôs Star Wars trilogy. One fan picked up on the resemblance of another two Hollywood leading ladies and would love to see them star in a film together.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=527 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true><strong>Rosario Dawson</strong>, known for her roles in the Netflix Marvel series and as Ahsoka in the Star Wars universe, responded to a fan on Twitter who would love to see the actress team up with her look-alike Zoe Salda√±a. Though the actresses are not as scarily similar looking as some other pairings, there are most definitely some resemblances between the two, enough that you could be mistaken for thinking they are related. One fan posted on Twitter that they would love to see them as onscreen sisters that ‚Äúwhoop ass.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Would be a blast. Love me some Zoe. Maybe one day we‚Äôll produce something to star in together‚Ä¶! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• <a href=#>@zoesaldana</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/3lnlYRmkml</a></p>‚Äî Rosario Dawson (@rosariodawson) <a href=#>October 26, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>Dawson responded by saying it ‚Äúwould be a blast‚Äù adding ‚Äúlove me some Zoe.‚Äù She goes further by saying that she would like to not only act in it but produce it together as well before tagging the actress in the tweet. Their outward appearances are not the only similarities that the actresses share having played similar characters on screen.</p><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>The two have both played non-human characters with Salda√±a having provided the body and voice for the character of Neytiri from James Cameron‚Äôs Avatar film as well as Gamora from the MCU. Dawson has also been a non-human differently colored character when playing Ahsoka in The Mandalorian, though she remained human for her role as Claire Temple in Netflix/Marvel‚Äôs various series. In all of these characters the two got to show off just how kick-ass they are, so imagine how strong they would be combined!</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>It would be great to see the two together, ‚Äúon earth or in space,‚Äù colorful or otherwise, and with one of the pair already on board, it now rests on Salda√±a to get on the bandwagon. You never know, fan pressure and peer pressure have worked wonders in the past, just look at Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman‚Äôs team-up for the upcoming Deadpool 3 as a prime example.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S%2FsL%2FAq6CoZZSWxLS7zWagrGWkpMGiuMuyZJ2np6N6p7vRZphmrJWWum7Bz2auoqyYYrWmvoyhpqWkqay8sLCMpaaoo12Wuaq3xGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-devils-backbone-2001.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Devil's Backbone movie review (2001)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cat-announces-s41-smartphone-5-inch-fhd-ip68-5000-mah.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>5 FHD, IP68+, 5000 mAh</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./constantine-abramson-net-worth-income-html.html>Constantine Abramson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dave-turley-biography-age-phreak-riot-games-threnody-wten-wtoc-mariah-congedo-covid-19-and-net-worth-2.html>Dave Turley Biography, Age, Phreak, Riot Games, Threnody, WTEN, WTOC, Mariah Congedo COVID-19, and N</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelly-pavliks-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Kelly Pavliks Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./margarida-bastos.html>Margarida Bastos, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Andrew Groves movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog.

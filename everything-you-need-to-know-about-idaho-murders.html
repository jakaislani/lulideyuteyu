In this article, we will be exploring what the Idaho murders really are.</p><p>Well, as the name implies it is a criminal situation and it happened on several occasions. The act was committed by one person whose name is Bryan Kohberger.</p><p>The 28-year-old suspected murderer gruesomely stabbed some students – Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Madison Mogen, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20.</p><p>These students were found dead inside their off-campus house in Moscow, Idaho, on November 13, 2022.</p><p>The suspect was pursuing a PhD in criminal justice at Washington State University at the time of the killings, and after the incident, he meticulously cleaned his car, inside and out.</p><p>He is now being held in Idaho awaiting his January 12 status hearing, and new information has emerged revealing some of the suspect’s movements in the days leading up to his arrest.</p><p>A surveillance team assigned to Kohberger was tasked with two missions: keeping an eye on the suspect so that he could be apprehended as soon as a warrant was issued, and attempting to obtain an object that would yield a DNA sample from the suspect, which could then be compared to DNA evidence found at the crime scene.</p><p>On Saturday, November 12, Goncalves and Mogen, lifelong best friends, went out to the Corner Club bar in Moscow.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chapin and Kernodle, who were dating, spent Saturday night at the Sigma Chi house.</p><p>On Sunday, November 13, around 1:40 a.m., Goncalves and Mogen were seen on video at Grub Truck, a local food vendor, and used a private individual to get a ride home, arriving at 1:45 a.m.</p><p>Chapin and Kernodle arrived home around 1:45 a.m. Chapin did not live at the house, but was visiting his girlfriend. The murders, according to police, took place between 4 a.m. and 4:25 a.m.</p><p>A security camera less than 50 feet from Kernodle’s room captured sounds of a barking dog and distorted audio of what sounded like voices or a whimper followed by a loud thud around 4:17 a.m.</p><p>On Nov. 13, the two roommates summoned friends to their home because they suspected one of the victims on the second floor had passed out and was not waking up. A 911 call from one of the roommates’ phones requested assistance for an unconscious person at 11:58 a.m.</p><p>The four victims were then discovered by responding officers. Authorities believe that no one at the house at the time of the 911 call was involved in the murders.</p><p>According to the documents, after the bodies were discovered, authorities reviewed surveillance video and saw the suspect’s white Hyundai Elantra pass by the victims’ house three times before entering the&nbsp;area for the fourth time at 4:04 a.m.</p><p>Police said they tracked the car’s path that night back to Kohberger’s home in Pullman, Washington.</p><p>Kohberger’s phone was tracked on its way to Moscow prior to the attack, but it was turned off between 2:47 a.m. and 4:48 a.m., consistent with Kohberger attempting to conceal his location during the quadruple homicide.</p><p>He also returned to the area of the house where the four students were killed shortly after 9 a.m., about five hours after the murders, according to phone records.</p><p>His phone was in the vicinity of the victims’ home at least 12 times prior to the murders, dating back to August. Except for one, all of those times were late at night or early in the morning.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp6tnqqpqbWqusZmsKitXaOyprCMraZmo56kxG6twaisrWWZma6pu4ymrKuclafAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-it-ok-to-use-frying-oil-more-than-once.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is it OK to use frying oil more than once?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elijah-moore-age-height-ethnicity-family-college-40-time-draft-trade-net-worth-instagram.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elijah Moore age, height, ethnicity, family, college, 40 time, draft, trade, net worth, Instagram</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./constantine-abramson-net-worth-income-html.html>Constantine Abramson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dave-turley-biography-age-phreak-riot-games-threnody-wten-wtoc-mariah-congedo-covid-19-and-net-worth-2.html>Dave Turley Biography, Age, Phreak, Riot Games, Threnody, WTEN, WTOC, Mariah Congedo COVID-19, and N</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelly-pavliks-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Kelly Pavliks Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./margarida-bastos.html>Margarida Bastos, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Andrew Groves movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog.

While all the children in the Wammy’s House orphanage are exceptionally smart, Near and Mello stood out above the rest and in turn received special guidance from L.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>His goals throughout the series are to become the new L and defeat the famed mass murderer Kira. Throughout the show, the connections to L are prevalent from his appearance, posture, personality, and decision-making.</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false>One thing that isn’t clear in the show is exactly how old Near is. While he looks to be a child, having just his time in an orphanage to gauge from determining the character’s correct age isn’t easy.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/intro-1617563704.jpeg alt="Death Note" width=1000 height=563 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2 data-injectable=false>How old is Near in Death Note?</h2><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>According to the manga, Near was born in 1991, while the anime is set a few years later making Near’s birth 1994. This would mean that at the conclusion of part one, when L is defeated by Kira, Near is 13 years old.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>In part two, once L’s successors have taken over and we are formally introduced to Near, he’s around 17 and ages at normal for the remainder of the series. In the anime, the series concludes in 2013 leading us to believe that Near is 18 years old at the end.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>While the anime closes the series with the death of Kira, the manga does continue with a few chapters set post-Kira investigation. These chapters are set a few years further into the future again and when the manga came to a close Near would have been around 20 years old.</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>In 2020, Death Note received its first new chapters in over a decade with the one-shot, “Tha a-Kira Story.” While there are some characters in these chapters returning from the original series, namely Ryuk, whose Death Note is at the center of its plot, Near also makes a return.</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=false>Having achieved his goal and taking the place of the new L, in these one-shots Near is far older. During the first chapter, it is four years after the end of the main series’ manga. With a two-year time skip before the next chapter Near is around 26 years old at the end of all current stories set in the world of <strong>Death Note.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvscCrZJqflWKxpq3ToWSnp6SafA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./history-culture.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jared Kushner - Family, Politics &amp;amp; Age</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fans-assume-a-kanye-west-mcdonalds-blissful-meal-is-coming-with-new-packaging-tassco.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fans assume a Kanye West McDonalds blissful meal is coming with new packaging Tassco The Talk</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./constantine-abramson-net-worth-income-html.html>Constantine Abramson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dave-turley-biography-age-phreak-riot-games-threnody-wten-wtoc-mariah-congedo-covid-19-and-net-worth-2.html>Dave Turley Biography, Age, Phreak, Riot Games, Threnody, WTEN, WTOC, Mariah Congedo COVID-19, and N</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelly-pavliks-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Kelly Pavliks Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./margarida-bastos.html>Margarida Bastos, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Andrew Groves movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog.

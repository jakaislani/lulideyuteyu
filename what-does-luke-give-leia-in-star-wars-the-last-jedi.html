Maybe it wasn’t the Star Wars we were expecting, but it did a lot of stuff right. For starters, it wasn’t Rise of Skywalker.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=346 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>In the one and only scene in the whole third trilogy featuring both Leia and Luke, we see our boy, Luke Skywalker, making a handoff with his twin sister. He regifts her a pair of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shining gold dice</a> on a chain, first seen very briefly hanging in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon in A New Hope, and then never again for more than 30 years.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=670 data-current-count=1016 data-injectable=true>There are in-universe and out-of-universe explanations for this keepsake. In-universe, the pair of Corellian Spike dice originally belonged to Han’s father, Ovan, a construction worker. Young Han inherited the dice and kept them with him, only parting with them when he passed them along to his beloved Qi’ra during the first act of Solo: A Star Wars Story. Qi’ra carried them with her for three years while she was separated from Han, returning them when the two were reunited ahead of an ill-fated robbery. The story goes that Han would later use the dice in a game of Corellian Spike against Lando Calrissian, winning himself one lightly-used <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Millennium Falcon</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hans-dice.png><p data-characters=621 data-current-count=921 data-injectable=true>Years passed. Han kept the dice hanging from his control console, then he didn’t. Then the sequel trilogy started building up steam and, somehow hurting for merchandisable iconography from the Star Wars franchise, Disney decided to really zero in on the accessory that Solo had briefly kept in his cockpit – that’s that out-of-universe explanation we mentioned earlier. The dice were recreated for The Force Awakens, then redesigned and heavily featured in The Last Jedi when Luke returned to the Falcon, giving the monastic amputee something to stare at sadly while he thought about his friend’s death.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>Out of respect for the love shared between his sister and Solo, Luke returned the dice to Leia on his way outside to fight Kylo Ren on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the barren salts of Crait</a>. It’s a heartbreaking moment between two people who’ve said everything there is to say.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=false>Only — psych, it turns out that it wasn’t really Luke, it was a Force projection of him, created for the sole purpose of messing with his nephew. The dice were also a Force projection, so they faded from existence around the same time that Luke did. As brotherly goodbyes go, handing your sister her dead ex’s old tchotchkes and then dying before she can realize it’s a prank is premium bullying.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGKxsLHSZqOuo5VitKrCxGajnqGRYravedKtmKtlp5a%2FtHnToZxmpJGowW62xJ2gaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./edwina-ritchard.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Edwina Ritchard</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shami-kareem-net-worth-320252.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shami Kareem Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./constantine-abramson-net-worth-income-html.html>Constantine Abramson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dave-turley-biography-age-phreak-riot-games-threnody-wten-wtoc-mariah-congedo-covid-19-and-net-worth-2.html>Dave Turley Biography, Age, Phreak, Riot Games, Threnody, WTEN, WTOC, Mariah Congedo COVID-19, and N</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelly-pavliks-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Kelly Pavliks Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./margarida-bastos.html>Margarida Bastos, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Andrew Groves movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog.

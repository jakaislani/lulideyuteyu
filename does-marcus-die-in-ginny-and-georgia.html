He’s not your run-of-the-mill high school student, and maybe that’s part of his appeal. He carves out a piece of your heart with authenticity and kindness, and he’s got enough snark and sass to lighten a dark mood. While Marcus himself has had to fight against his own darkness, he’s learning that life is a balancing act, acknowledging when to take the reins and when to release them.</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>Ginny and Georgia is as much a drama as it is a coming-of-age tale, recognizing the good and the bad, the bright and the dark, and the wonderful and downright awful. Each character holds a piece of a fundamental peaches puzzle, and Marcus is a definite fan favorite.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>Marcus’ character hasn’t had an easy ride, and if you’ve stumbled upon this article, chances are — you’re asking yourself an important question. Is Marcus alive? As someone who has watched Ginny and Georgia enough for it to be called a comfort show, I’ve got the answer for you. So sit back, relax, and read on — as usual, we’ve got you covered.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-marcus-baker data-injectable=false>Who is Marcus Baker?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 𝐆𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐲 & 𝐆𝐞𝐨𝐫𝐠𝐢𝐚 (@gngbts)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=797 data-injectable=true>How does one describe Marcus Baker? At first glance, it would be easy to write him off as the stereotypical bad boy; climbing through windows, riding motorcycles, wearing shirts that say Wednesday on a Monday, and being too cool for fun. Marcus is handsome, well-read, musically inclined, and charming — but there’s much more under the surface than that. He’s also a multifaceted and layered character, someone in touch with his emotions; despite his best efforts to appear blasé.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Marcus Butler is also a twin, a son, a boyfriend, and a bit of a tortured soul. Felix Mallard breathes life into the character with charisma, sarcasm, and both a joy for life and a realization that it’s not always sunshine and rainbows; he’s a relatable character with a lot of room for growth, self-reflection, and a more significant impact on those around him than he could imagine.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=824 data-injectable=true>As a character, Marcus is an essential piece of the puzzle of Ginny & Georgia, and the series wouldn’t have moved forward without him, it couldn’t have. While he breaks his heart open in vulnerable moments, he also brings a light to a room, even when he doesn’t realize it. If you’ve not yet watched Ginny and Georgia, let us be the (not first) to tell you — you’ll quickly fall for Marcus.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What happens to Marcus in season 1 of Ginny and Georgia?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 𝐆𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐲 & 𝐆𝐞𝐨𝐫𝐠𝐢𝐚 (@gngbts)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>Marcus and Ginny experienced some highs and lows together throughout the first season of Ginny & Georgia, and one of their most intense was a conversation they shared, a moment of anger, and an accident.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>When Marcus climbs into Ginny’s window, as he often did, he finds herself in the middle of a self-harm episode. He sees her causing herself pain, and he doesn’t know what to do. He makes a confession to her, one of vulnerability and honestly — in part — likely a declaration of compassion towards her, and she doesn’t want to hear it.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>That’s right, the boy Ginny would follow anywhere finally tells her that he loves her, and in her pain, she pushes him away, saying everything in her power to hurt him enough to make him leave. To not allow him to see her in that state any longer, not to cause her any more harm.</p><p>“I can’t believe I was so into you, always lurking outside my window like a loser … Your problem is that you’re incapable of anything real. You’re a joke. Now get out.”</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>When Marcus hears those words, he listens and leaves — but it doesn’t end there. He hops on his bike, and in a completely emotional state, he isn’t driving with the dedication riding a motorcycle requires. The sounds of tires screeching soon filled the air, quickly followed by the sound of an intense crash — Marcus’ fate hung in the balance, and Ginny had no idea.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is Marcus still alive?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 𝐆𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐲 & 𝐆𝐞𝐨𝐫𝐠𝐢𝐚 (@gngbts)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=747 data-current-count=1047 data-injectable=true>Fans of Ginny & Georgia know that Marcus is still alive, and we’re grateful for it, but the accident certainly put a lot of things into perspective for one of our favorite television characters. When Ginny finds out, she’s distraught, but she knows she can’t go to him how she’d like. For those who haven’t seen the series yet, we won’t give too many spoilers into the intricate details — hey, if you’re googling if Marcus lives or dies, we’re allowed to give that part away. As we said, Ginny soon realizes that she can’t run to Marcus as she’d like to, but she’s going to find a way to ensure that the last thing they say to one another aren’t words that cause pain.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>As Ginny goes to Marcus’ house to visit his twin sister, one of her best friends, she steals a moment to go visit the man who has her heart — even if she shouldn’t. When he first sees her, you can tell he’s a little bit caught off guard; she’s probably the person he’s wanted to see the most, but she’s also the girl who hurt him deeply. However, his defenses are soon obsolete when he sees how much hurt and responsibility Ginny carries.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=772 data-injectable=true>So yes, Marcus is alive after the accident, but season two brings more ups and downs for him, including a reunion with depression that he wasn’t prepared for. Everything should have been going his way, but mental health doesn’t care about your best-laid plans. Luckily, his loved ones helped to turn over a new page for him, supporting him and recognizing that he was going through a place in his life that was not what he expected, and loving him through it.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What does the future look like for Marcus?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 𝐆𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐲 & 𝐆𝐞𝐨𝐫𝐠𝐢𝐚 (@gngbts)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true>So what’s next for Marcus in seasons three and four? First things first, we hope that he reaches a plane of mental health that allows him to see the bright side again, even if he gets there slowly. Marcus is an easy character to root for, and fans just want him to be okay.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>Second — we hope he gets back with Ginny. Yes, that’s a selfish desire, but they were quite the pair. The way they spoke with one another, looked at each other like they were the only ones in the room, and fought each other’s darkness said a lot. The compassion they share for one another is next level, and even just in their moments as friends, they’re a powerhouse pair.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>We also hope Marcus dives more into his art. He’s so immensely talented, and we’d love to see him realize what he could do with that passion, all of the lives he could change with works of art.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>You can catch up on all things Ginny and Georgia by streaming the first two seasons on Netflix now, and if you haven’t already, be prepared to carve out a piece of your heart for Marcus Baker.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylu8SsZKaZopjCtHnDopxmoZ5itKq6zbJkmqaUYrSmu9GgoJpn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rico-abreu-girlfriend-or-wife-who-is-meagan-droud-their-dating-life-explored.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rico Abreu Girlfriend Or Wife: Who Is Meagan Droud?

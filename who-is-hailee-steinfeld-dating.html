She first landed her breakthrough as a 14-year-old in the 2010 film,<i> True Gift</i>, for which she earned a BAFTA award and an Oscar nomination. &nbsp;</p><p>Steinfeld grew her onscreen presence with roles in <i>Ten Thousand Saints, Romeo & Juliet, Ender's Game,</i> and more recently, <i>Bumblebee, Hawkeye,</i> and <i>Dickinson</i>, in which she portrayed American poet <strong>Emily Dickinson.</strong> Steinfeld is one of the few child stars who've gracefully transitioned into an A-lister without any career-derailing scandals or moments of notoriety. &nbsp;</p><h3>Who is Hailee Steinfeld Dating? &nbsp;</h3><p>Hailee has been off the market for a while it seems. The <i>Love Myself</i> crooner is of course yet to make it official but it's no longer a secret. Steinfeld has been dating NFL player, <strong>Josh Allen</strong>, for weeks. Several sources have confirmed the budding romance between the two after the two were spotted making out on a getaway. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/7/319744053_178826408161807_6793702072774169873_n%20(1)%20(1)-1688750007223.jpg><p>Steinfeld and Allen jetted off for a romantic trip to Mexico, where the duo packed heavy on PDAs. The steamy makeout session comes a month after the songstress and her new beau were pictured on a stroll in NYC. Dishing on the duo's new romance, an insider <a href=#>said,</a> "It's new and they are having fun." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/7/345479060_1283277062565831_8545601707695445314_n%20(1)%20(1)-1688750031255.jpg><p>While fans await more deets on the twosome's budding relationship, here's everything to know about Allen. Josh has been playing quarterback position for the Buffalo Bills of the NFL since 2018. Drafted as the seventh overall pick, Josh initially played as a back QB to <strong>Nathan Petermen</strong>. Allen led the team to the division title in 2020, their first since 1995. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Steinfeld and Allen's many PDA-packed appearances are enough to set off the new couple alert!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>Before starting the ongoing steamy romance with the actress-turned-singer, Allen was in a long-term relationship with <strong>Brittany Williams,</strong> a former cheerleader who she started dating in college. Allen and Williams seemingly broke up in late 2021. &nbsp;</p><h3>Dive into Hailee Steinfeld's Romantic History! &nbsp;</h3><p>Steinfeld has navigated a high-profile professional journey and dealt with the constant scrutiny with grace. The Oscar-nominated actress surely has experienced her share of romances in an industry filled with attractive men, but the<i> Let Me Go </i>hitmaker isn't known to be the most forthcoming star when it comes to her love life. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/7/324165592_151390217685723_5124505384134990924_n%20(1)%20(1)-1688750041156.jpg><p>In fact, throughout her life in the limelight, which spans from her early teenage years to now, Steinfeld has only ever sparked a couple of dating headlines. Hailee's first public relationship was with Instagram influencer <strong>Cameron Smoller</strong>, with whom she was first linked in 2016. &nbsp;</p><p>The<i> Edge of Seventeen</i> actress even made her red-carpet debut with Smoller at a Golden Globes afterparty, in 2017. Aside from their several public appearances, Hailee and Cameron would often appear on each other's Instagram. But what was thought to be a beginning of an adorable romance turned out to be a fleeting experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/7/315149888_6093406897336144_6019838872918606110_n%20(1)%20(1)-1688750048185.jpg><p>Steinfeld and Smoller reportedly called it quits in late 2017. But for what it's worth, the pair seems to have maintained a friendly relationship. The two were spotted enjoying a reunion at a <strong>Billie Eilish</strong> concert in 2019. Hailee's most notable romance still remains a mystery. &nbsp;</p><p>She was linked with former One Direction singer, <strong>Niall Horan</strong>, in 2018. The rumored couple was first spotted watching Hamilton at London's West End, in mid-2018. Amid the brewing romance rumors, Steinfeld and the Slow Hands crooner gave the speculation a green light as they packed on PDA in LA, in August 2018. &nbsp;</p><p>But despite the rising interest in the then-new love birds' love story, Steinfeld and Horn gave fans little to nothing. The duo's romance reportedly fizzled out in December of the same year. The <i>Starving</i> hitmaker is believed to have alluded to her budding romance with Nial in a Cosmopolitan interview, in 2018. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/7/249113398_4840267605985433_43282316046627960_n%20(1)%20(1)-1688750056587.jpg><p>"When you fall in love, you pick up on the tiniest things about yourself," <a href=#>Hailee said </a>before adding, "I am one to spread out on the mattress and take up every inch of space." <i>The Dickinson</i> actress also explained the high walls around her personal life. &nbsp;</p><p>"I am a very private person. I do love that I have the opportunity to share with them what I’m comfortable with and they're there to listen and support me," said the Oscar-nominated actress. Aside from the aforementioned relationships, Hailee was also linked with <strong>Charlie Puth</strong> and <strong>Justin Bieber</strong> but the rumors were short-lived due to lack of substantial proof. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jrCfqGWZqHqprcilnJ5lo6myqrrFnqOdZZSWwaq6xg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ana-de-armas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ana De Armas Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-wayans-family-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Wayans Family Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./constantine-abramson-net-worth-income-html.html>Constantine Abramson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dave-turley-biography-age-phreak-riot-games-threnody-wten-wtoc-mariah-congedo-covid-19-and-net-worth-2.html>Dave Turley Biography, Age, Phreak, Riot Games, Threnody, WTEN, WTOC, Mariah Congedo COVID-19, and N</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelly-pavliks-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Kelly Pavliks Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./margarida-bastos.html>Margarida Bastos, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Andrew Groves movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog.

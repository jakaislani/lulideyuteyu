Now, not so much.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>Moore — who was married to Kutcher from 2005-2013 — revealed in her biography Inside Out that she and her then-hubby had mutliple threesomes and also accused Kutcher of destroying her sobriety, explaining that she began drinking again because Ashton, despite knowing of Demi’s struggles, would often casually drink a glass of wine in front of her. She also detailed an affair he had while they were married, something the press had reported several years earlier.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>Ashton expressed his frustration today in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Esquire</a>, apparently annoyed by the book’s content and the timing of its release. When the book came out, Kutcher and Mila Kunis had already been married for four years. Kutcher explains, “I’d finally gotten to a place where the press had really laid off me and Mila and my life and my family.”</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>To say Kutcher was annoyed at what Demi revealed in her memoir is an understatement but, despite still having a relationship with her grown children, it’s unclear if Demi gave a forewarning of any kind to Ashton about the contents of the book. One would assume not, considering Kutcher’s reaction.</p><p data-characters=41 data-current-count=41 data-injectable=false>“I was fu**ing pissed!” Kutcher said.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>He was also upset with the paparazzi the day after the book’s release, explaining, “The next day, they (the paparazzi) are at my kid’s school,” he then hesitated before continuing, however. Not wanting to dive further into his frustration of the 2019 memoir and the negative attention it brought to him and his family, Ashton stopped himself by saying, “I don’t want to open anything up in that realm.”</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>Demi Moore detailed in her memoir that opening herself up to threesomes at Ashton’s request ultimately led to him cheating on her. She wrote, “I put him first. So when he expressed his fantasy of bringing a third person into our bed, I didn’t say no. I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be.”</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>When Ashton <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly cheated on her</a>, Demi blamed herself then explained, “Because we had brought in a third party into our relationship, Ashton said, that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he’s done.”</p><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=119 data-injectable=false>Kutcher said today about their divorce, “It’s humiliating and embarrassing. You own the sh** and you go forward.”</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>He also expressed how the marriage ending hit him hard. He explained that it took “fu**ing tons” of work just to accept that his marriage had failed, adding, “Nothing makes you feel like a failure like divorce.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SutLTTqKVmo6WpsKmx0WaqoZmimsButMisZJ%2BhlafGbr7EmpqtoZ%2BjerW7jJ2cpqFdorywvsSsZKadnaS2s3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-fong-torres.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Fong Torres Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-the-i-gotta-put-me-first-tiktok-trend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is the I gotta put me first TikTok trend?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./constantine-abramson-net-worth-income-html.html>Constantine Abramson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dave-turley-biography-age-phreak-riot-games-threnody-wten-wtoc-mariah-congedo-covid-19-and-net-worth-2.html>Dave Turley Biography, Age, Phreak, Riot Games, Threnody, WTEN, WTOC, Mariah Congedo COVID-19, and N</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelly-pavliks-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Kelly Pavliks Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./margarida-bastos.html>Margarida Bastos, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Andrew Groves movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog.

During his reign as a leading radio personality in the '90s, he marketed himself as a Hollywood outsider who hated everyone in the system and wouldn't bat an eyelash slinging insults at whatever he fancied. "I fart on the air," he used to say. Along with his co-hosts, he also had segments for the sole purpose of degrading women, asking them to strip or hop on weighing scales or even flinging meat to their behinds. He didn't care who he offended because he meant to offend.</p><p>"The way that I felt that I could get mass audiences and ensure I'd get to work another day was to be the most outlandish, the most wild, the most funny and controversial, like a guy who had just gotten out of an insane asylum," he explained to <a href=#>The New York Times Magazine</a>. "I was unleashing parts of my brain that I probably should've kept quiet, but I felt it was a legitimate way to do radio."&nbsp;His insistence on being the most outrageous and controversial for sustained attention often led him to take things too far. He joked about masturbating to a photo of Aunt Jemima, mocked Selena's death a day before her funeral, and made light of the Columbine High School shooting. He didn't care as long as it earned him listeners, and the most shocking part is that he has no regrets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtmaoB2hY6hprCZopl6tMDEq6VmqKKkr62xzJqroptdnba0wM6rsGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hail-caesar-2016.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hail, Caesar! movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2016)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./benny-soliven.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>YouTuber Benny Soliven is expecting his first child with girlfriend, Alondra Ortiz</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./constantine-abramson-net-worth-income-html.html>Constantine Abramson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dave-turley-biography-age-phreak-riot-games-threnody-wten-wtoc-mariah-congedo-covid-19-and-net-worth-2.html>Dave Turley Biography, Age, Phreak, Riot Games, Threnody, WTEN, WTOC, Mariah Congedo COVID-19, and N</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelly-pavliks-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Kelly Pavliks Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./margarida-bastos.html>Margarida Bastos, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Andrew Groves movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog.

And like a good friend, microwave mac and cheese is always there for you. Plus, it’s quick, reliable, and easy. You just need the correct household appliance and you can have a warm, comforting meal ready in minutes. When I was growing up, microwavable mac and cheese was a tasty, convenient snack and I always loved it. As an adult, however, my food standards are higher and it doesn’t always hold up.</p><p>Most of the microwavable macs we tried were bad (like, very, very bad), but we found an elite few that are worthy of gracing your grocery cart. The microwavable macaroni and cheeses on our list are creamy, affordable, and, above all else, quick!</p><p>Before I get into that, I do want to address that most microwave mac and cheese has instructions that I think are wrong. If you’ve ever had a watery cup or instant mac and cheese, follow these rules that I made up that are correct. Deal with it, Kraft!</p><li><strong>Make sure to only microwave one cup at a time.</strong> This isn’t listed on the container, but it is important for cooking. If you try to cook two at once, you’re more likely to mess up the texture of the noodles.</li><li><strong>Add in the powder ahead of time.</strong> All of these have you add the powder after cooking and I do not understand why. If you add the powder with the water before cooking, it makes the sauce so creamy and thick.</li><li><strong>Drain the water. </strong>If you don’t want to add the cheese powder prior to cooking, drain the noodles! It explicitly tells you not to, but that is wrong. You don’t have to drain out all the liquid, but at least drain some. If you don’t, some of these are way too watery.</li><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/RANKING-UPDATE_MICROWAVE-MAC-N-CHEESE_INSET-06.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Gluten Free</p><strong>Kraft Gluten Free Original Mac & Cheese Cups</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>Whoa! This is actually good! While it’s obviously not as good as its gluten-full counterparts, it’s a great option for the celiac community. The noodles are tender, the cheese sauce is creamy, and it cooks up quick. It was better than a lot of the regular microwaveable mac and cheese cups we tried. Gluten-free stoners should keep these on hand at all times. I guess it would also be good for kids.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/RANKING-UPDATE_MICROWAVE-MAC-N-CHEESE_INSET-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Noodles</p><strong>Kraft Mac & Cheese Shapes</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>The shapes make it better. If you don’t agree with me, you’re wrong. The way the cheese sauce gets into every nook and cranny is ideal. It’s so much better than the regular Kraft mac and cheese, which is really, really good. This is pure nostalgia in a cup, but it also actually tastes delicious. Fond childhood memories alone aren’t making you like it. This microwave mac and cheese is genuinely tasty.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/RANKING-UPDATE_MICROWAVE-MAC-N-CHEESE_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best as a Side</p><strong>Bob Evans Tasteful Sides Macaroni & Cheese</strong><p>It is so funny to me that they call this tub of microwavable macaroni and cheese “tasteful.” That being said, it is tasty! Bob Evans’s mac tastes like a better version of KFC’s mac and cheese. It shines when it comes to sodium—it’s so scrumptiously salty! <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justine Sterling</a>, editor-in-chief of Sporked, loved the “extreme cheese coverage” that was luscious without being overwhelming.

This broccoli cheddar rendition is so much better. It’s exactly like Panera’s broccoli cheddar soup mixed with Panera’s mac and cheese, except you don’t have to leave your house or buy and mix two different items together. This is creamy, a little tangy, and rich. I don’t think I’ll ever go to a Panera again.

It comes with multiple flavor packets and a little bag of breadcrumbs, which our team had conflicting feelings about. Some of us thought they tasted a little raw, while others thought they added a great crunch. But we could all agree on one thing: This mac and cheese is creamy, sumptuous, and delicious.

And this microwaveable mac and cheese isn’t just good. It’s great. It tastes like you made it on the stovetop. It’s so creamy. The shells were perfectly al dente.

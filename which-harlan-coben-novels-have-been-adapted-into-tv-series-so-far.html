So, if you’ve just finished Fool Me Once <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and you’re looking for more</a> like it, you’re in luck.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>He’s one of the most prolific murder mystery writers in the game at the moment, having written 34 books and not showing signs of slowing down. Netflix has made eight series with Coben’s name attached so far, although only seven are adapted from his books, with Safe (2018) being an original series written by the author. If you want to know which of those shows are the best, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ve also made a neat list ranking them from best to worst.</a></p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Netflix isn’t the only one looking to work with the author as other streaming platforms and networks have also turned his books into series. There was also a French film based on his book Tell No One way back in 2006. Even though that’s a movie, not a series, it gets an honorable mention for being the first proper Coben adaptation.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>Coming back to the exceptional TV adaptations of his work, the shows come from all over the place, a handful have been filmed and set in the U.K., while others became a silver screen reality in Poland, France, and Spain. But <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the setting doesn’t really count</a>, what matters is the story, the mystery, and the suspense.</p><h2 id=h-fool-me-once-2024 data-injectable=false>Fool Me Once (2024)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fool-Me-Once.jpg><p data-characters=29 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>Based on: Fool Me Once (2016)</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>This is the most recent series to be released on Netflix. The story follows Maya, a grieving widow who finds footage that proves her dead husband might not be as dead as he’s supposed to be. From there Maya begins unraveling a wild conspiracy that also links her sister’s death to the convoluted mess of secrets connected to her husband. The plot will keep you guessing right up until the end.</p><h2 id=h-shelter-2023 data-injectable=false>Shelter (2023)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/harlan-cobens-shelter-2.jpg><p data-characters=24 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Based on: Shelter (2011)</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>This is one of the few TV series based on Coben’s works to be adapted by another streaming network. After seeing all the success Netflix had found with previous adaptations, seems like Amazon wanted a piece of that pie too.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>In Shelter, when a strange old woman tells Mickey that his father isn’t dead, he begins uncovering the dark underbelly of his quiet suburban town. Despite being on a different platform, the limited series still feels just like the other Coben shows over at Netflix and is as captivating as the other wonders bringing Coben’s imagination to life.</p><h2 id=h-hold-tight-2022 data-injectable=false>Hold Tight (2022)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/hold-tight-netflix.jpg><p data-characters=27 data-current-count=27 data-injectable=false>Based on: Hold Tight (2008)</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>After the death of his friend, teenager Adam goes missing, and as the story turns to his family and the aftermath, secrets are exposed and people’s lives begin to unravel. It’s one of the shorter Coben adaptations (being only six episodes in total), but that just means you can binge the whole thing in one evening because let’s be honest, once your brain is obsessed with its plot, it won’t let you sleep unless you how it all ends.</p><h2 id=h-stay-close-2021 data-injectable=false>Stay Close (2021)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image1-2.jpg><p data-characters=27 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>Based on: Stay Close (2012)</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>The investigation into the case of a missing person links to a similar cold case from a long time ago. As DS Michael Broome falls deeper into the mystery, it threatens to reveal not only his dark secrets, but the secrets of others as well. It’s got all the mainstays of a classic Harlan Coben series — murder, mystery, and most importantly, Richard Armitage.</p><h2 id=h-gone-for-good-2021 data-injectable=false>Gone for Good (2021)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gone-for-Good.jpg><p data-characters=30 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Based on: Gone for Good (2002)</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>Once again we see a protagonist unraveling a mystery after a loved one goes missing. We’re starting to notice a pattern with these Harlan Coben stories, but hey, people always say that stick to what you’re good at and there’s no doubt that the author is very good at accurately portraying the specific brand of chaos that spreads when dark secrets, hidden for decades, are finally revealed.</p><h2 id=h-the-innocent-2021 data-injectable=false>The Innocent (2021)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Innocent.jpg><p data-characters=29 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>Based on: The Innocent (2005)</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>Almost a decade after accidentally killing a man, Mateo has started his life over, but it seems like the past isn’t done with him as a mysterious phone call threatens to resurrect the not-so-good old days. Arguably this Spanish adaptation of the 2005 novel of the same name is one of the best Coben adaptations — with a solid 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, this isn’t one to miss out on.</p><h2 id=h-the-woods-2020 data-injectable=false>The Woods (2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Woods.jpg><p data-characters=26 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Based on: The Woods (2007)</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=796 data-injectable=true>Another mysterious murder and another great example of Coben’s writing combined with stellar acting. The Woods follows a Polish prosecutor, Paweł Kopiński, who is called upon to identify the body of a murder victim. Kopiński suspects that it might all be linked to another murder and the disappearance of his sister, which occurred 25 years prior. The story takes place in two time periods, 1994 and 2019, as we go forward and backward between the past and present.</p><h2 id=h-the-stranger-2020 data-injectable=false>The Stranger (2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Stranger.jpg><p data-characters=29 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>Based on: The Stranger (2015)</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>By now you should know the drill — a disappearance, dark secrets, Richard Armitage is there too.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>When family man Adam Price’s wife goes missing, he embarks on a quest to discover what happened to her. At the same time, a stranger shows up in the town threatening to expose the dark secrets kept by the people around Adam. Also, there’s a weird subplot involving a decapitated alpaca, but trust me, it is all neatly tied up by the end.</p><h2 id=h-no-second-chance-2015 data-injectable=false>No Second Chance (2015)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/No-Second-Chance.jpg><p data-characters=33 data-current-count=33 data-injectable=false>Based on: No Second Chance (2003)</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>The beginning of the Coben adaptations, this mini-series created for French television isn’t as well known as the rest. The plot revolves around Alice Lambert, a doctor whose husband is killed and her daughter is kidnapped. When the police fail to help, Lambert hatches her own plan to find her daughter and get revenge.</p><h2 id=h-will-there-be-future-adaptations data-injectable=false>Will there be future adaptations?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fool-Me-Once-Netflix-Maya-Joe.jpg><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Back in 2018, Netflix signed a five-year contract to adapt 14 Harlan Coben novels. While it’s been more than five years, it looks like the streaming giant is still obligated to produce six more stories. Considering how successful they’ve been making more of these seems like a no-brainer.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>And as we’ve seen, Netflix isn’t the only platform vying for the rights to adapt some Coben novels. Amazon has already had a go and there’s clearly interest from other parts of the world with French, Spanish, and Polish series all based on his book. It’s only a matter of time before somebody else aspires to take a stab at it.</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=141 data-injectable=false>Nothing has been confirmed yet regarding what the next adaptation will be, but we can daydream — there are plenty of novels to choose from!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMicn2agkae5orqMnKabnZ5iu7DCxKWqZqCRq7JursSepWaZlJa9tbHDZqCnrJ9iwbd50p6pop2jYsCwecWaqWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bella-heathcote-age-height-movies-husband-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bella Heathcote: Career, Movies, Husband &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./julian-seager.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Julian Seager Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./constantine-abramson-net-worth-income-html.html>Constantine Abramson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dave-turley-biography-age-phreak-riot-games-threnody-wten-wtoc-mariah-congedo-covid-19-and-net-worth-2.html>Dave Turley Biography, Age, Phreak, Riot Games, Threnody, WTEN, WTOC, Mariah Congedo COVID-19, and N</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelly-pavliks-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Kelly Pavliks Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./margarida-bastos.html>Margarida Bastos, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Andrew Groves movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog.

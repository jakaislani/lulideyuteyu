When our fingers and toes would start to tingle from the cold, Iâ€™d come inside and make this hot chocolate recipe. Itâ€™s thick and comforting, the perfect fortifying treat on a chilly winter day.

These roasted pumpkin seeds are toasty, nutty, salty, and crunchy â€“ a healthy autumn treat thatâ€™s just too good to miss. If you have kids, I think this recipe would be a great one to make with them. Half the work is separating the seeds from the squishy, slimy pumpkin flesh. In all honesty, I still have fun getting my hands messy doing it, so I can only imagine that it would be a blast for kiddos too. ðŸ™‚ How to Roast Pumpkin Seedsâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Last week I shared this cherry tomato pasta recipe, and now Iâ€™m onto these Caprese skewersâ€¦ If you couldnâ€™t tell, Iâ€™m having a moment with cherry tomatoes. I love how many different varieties are available at this time of year â€“ some are round and yellow, others are oblong and speckled with red. Still others are purple, orange, and green. When I see all these shapes and colors at the farmers market or grocery store, I can never resist bringing home some of each. Theyâ€™re just so darn pretty (and delicious, too!).

For the next few weeks, Iâ€™ll come home with a bag of peaches after every trip to the farmers market or store. The season is just so short, so while itâ€™s here, and fresh peaches are juicy, sweet, and abundant, I make it my goal to eat as many of them as I can. Some I devour plain, their sticky juice dripping down my chin. But I use even more in my favorite peach recipes. As you might expect, these peach recipes include desserts like crisps and cobblers.

I should know, because Iâ€™ve just finished my [redacted] slice of the season, and I donâ€™t see my healthy zucchini bread consumption slowing down anytime soon. ðŸ™‚ Like a traditional recipe, this healthy zucchini bread is moist, tender, and warmly spiced. Itâ€™s PACKED with zucchini, of course, but it also features a few other good-for-you ingredients that you wouldnâ€™t find in a regular loaf. Almond flour adds protein and healthy fats, and it gives this loaf an especially moist texture. And instead of melted butter, olive oil brings richness.â€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Youâ€™d be hard pressed to find an easier summer dessert than this peach crisp recipe.

But these breakfast cookies arenâ€™t just good for you. Theyâ€™re also delicious! The same ingredients that pack them with nutrients give them a sweet, nutty flavor and soft, puffy texture.
